## 🔍 Key Steps in the Analysis

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Handled missing values, encoded features, and prepared the dataset for analysis.

- **Exploratory Visualization**  
  Analyzed survival trends based on **gender**, **passenger class**, and **age groups** using statistical and graphical methods.

- **Feature & Correlation Analysis**  
  Examined relationships between variables to identify which features played significant roles in survival rates.

- **Insights & Interpretation**  
  Derived meaningful conclusions from visual patterns and summary statistics.
